# Abstract: 
The idea of this project is to design and develop a Med AI platform, and it includes three key features: a medical chatbot, symptom checker, and hospital location tracker. The medical chatbot is used to give live responses to health issues and solutions; the symptom checker is used to check symptoms by input provided by the users, thus reducing unwanted clinic visits by giving the right guidance at the right moment. In hospital location tracker, for finding the closest Healthcare facilities close to the users we use their pin code, streamlines quick access to medical support. It thus combines to create all-rounded, accessible, efficient AI-driven healthcare, Med Ai can be easily accessed by the common people. We can provide services to the people in rural areas free of cost.
